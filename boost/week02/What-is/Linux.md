# What is Linux?

Linux is a Unix-like operating system created by Linus Torvalds at the University of Helsinki in 1991. The name Linux refers to the Linux kernel.  
The development of Linux was a landmark example of global, free and open source software collaboration. Many companies and similar numbers of individuals have released their own version of Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux Kernel. 

Similar to Unix kernels, the Linux kernel relays instructions from an application from the computer's processor and sends the results back to the application. 

Broader in scope than commercial Unix products, Linux has been installed on a variety of platforms including mobile phones, tablets, video game consoles, NAS storage arrays, routers and small embedded controllers.  

The development of Linux is a stellar example of the power of free and open source software development and global human collaboration.  
A Linux "distribution" is a release of a Unix-like operating system based on the specifications of the Linux kernel.  

**Key Features:**

  *  Linux, like Unix, is a multi-user system where the resources can be shared by various system users.
  *  Linux, like Unix, provides multi-tasking. Users can execute many processes at the same time (practically speaking).
  *  Linux, like Unix, was written in C.
  *  Linux, like Unix, provides a hierarchical file structure which facilitated fast data access.
  *  Linux, like Unix, has built-in networking functions so that computers can easily exchange information.
  *  Linux, unlike UNIX, specifies only the kernel but not the entire operating system.
