 # UNIX
 
All **UNIX**, Linux and other Unix-like operating systems are families of computer operating systems derived from the original Unix System from Bell Telephone Laboratories. Today, the largest Unix descendent directly certified as "UNIX" is macOS by Apple. The original commercial Unix derivatives included HP-UX, AIX and SunOS, to name a few.
  
The basic concepts of Unix were originated in the Multics project of 1969. The Multics system was intended as a time-sharing system that would allow multiple users to simultaneously access a mainframe computer. Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others developed the basic building blocks of Unix including a hierarchical file system and a command line interpreter for the PDP-7. Multiple generations of Unix systems were developed for myriad computers.

Unix systems are characterized by a modular design that is sometimes called the "Unix philosophy". According to this philosophy, the operating system should provide a set of simple tools, each of which performs a limited, well-defined function. A unified and inode-based filesystem (the Unix filesystem) and an inter-process communication mechanism known as "pipes" serve as the main means of communication, and a shell scripting and command language (the Unix shell) is used to combine the tools to perform complex workflows.

**Key Features**:

  * Unix is a multi-user system where the resources can be shared by various system users.
  * Unix provides multi-tasking. Users can execute many processes at the same time (practically speaking).
  * Unix was the first computer operating system that was written in a high-level language (C Language).
  * Unix provides a hierarchical file structure which facilitated fast data access.
  * Unix has built-in networking functions so that computers can easily exchange information.
  * Unix functionality can be extended through user programs built on a standard programming interface.
  * Unix source code was not freely available to the general public.
  * Unix certifies compliance with a full set of interoperability standard, managed and maintained by the Open Group, which includes, not only the kernel, but the entire operating system.
