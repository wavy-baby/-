# What is Linux?

![tux](/lang/markdown/img/tux.png)
 
**Linux** is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the [Linux kernel](https://github.com/wavy-baby/Primo/blob/main/boost/week02/Linux-Kernel.md#what-is-the-linux-kernel), an operating system kernel written from scratch by Linus Torvalds with assistance from a loosely-knit team of hackers across the Net.

Linux is typically packaged in a Linux distribution. Distributions include the Linux kernel and supporting system software and libraries, many of which are provided by the GNU Project. Many Linux distributions use the word "Linux" in their name, but the Free Software Foundation uses the name **GNU/Linux** to emphasize the importance of GNU software, causing some controversy. 

Many companies and similar numbers of individuals have released their own version of Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux Kernel. 
[Ubuntu](https://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=ubuntu), [Linux Mint](https://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=mint), and [MX Linux](https://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=mx) are considered the easiest for new users who want to get productive in Linux as soon as possible without having to master all its complexities. On the other end of the spectrum, [Arch Linux](https://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=arch), [Gentoo](https://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=gentoo), and [Slackware Linux](https://distrowatch.com/slackware) are more advanced distributions that require plenty of learning before they can be used effectively. [openSUSE](https://distrowatch.com/openSuse), [Fedora](https://distrowatch.com/fedora), [Debian](https://distrowatch.com/debian) GNU/Linux can be classified as good "middle-road" distributions which are often used as the basis for other distributions. Popular Commercial distributions include [Red Hat Enterprise Linux](https://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=redhat) and [SUSE Linux Enterprise](https://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=sle). Most Desktop Linux distributions include a windowing system such as X11 or Wayland, and a desktop environment such as GNOME or KDE Plasma.

Linux can be installed on almost every computing capable device like PCs, laptops, mobile phones, tablets, smart watches, video game consoles, NAS storage arrays, routers and small embedded controllers.  

#### **Key Features:**

  *  Linux, like UNIX, is a multi-user system where the resources can be shared by various system users.
  *  Linux, like UNIX, provides multi-tasking. Users can execute many processes at the same time (practically speaking).
  *  Linux, like UNIX, was written in C.
  *  Linux, like UNIX, provides a hierarchical file structure which facilitated fast data access.
  *  Linux, like UNIX, has built-in networking functions so that computers can easily exchange information.
  *  Linux, unlike UNIX, is free and open source.
  *  Linux, unlike UNIX, specifies only the kernel but not the entire operating system.
